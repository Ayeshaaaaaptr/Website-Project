# Simple Website Project
Here's all my website project.

As time goes by and my knowledge of web programming, I will create more simple website projects.
I know it's not perfect, but if it's helpful don't forget to give a **star** :)

# List of projects

- **N&N Coffee** - This is my _first_ project I have ever made. you can see how dumb I am :D 

- **BILL-All About Tech** - This is my _second_ project. along with the development of knowledge that I learned about HTML and CSS. I created a landing page which already has **Responsive Features** on mobile and tablet.

- **MORE PROJECTS COMING SOON!** - _Stay tune!_

# Edits & Forks
Feel free to fork the project and tweak, fix, add to the code. I tried to add as many **useful comments** to the code as it's possible, so code should be **easy to read** even though it was **written in just a few hours**.
I'll be fixing and adding more features to the code, when I'll see a need to.

# Support for me!
Buy me a coffee if you think I earned it! **Any amount means a lot** for me.

**Thank you for supporting me!!!**
